I was facing same problem, here is what I did that worked for me.

Use ssh instead of http. Remove origin if its http.

git remote rm origin
Add ssh url

git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git
Generate ssh key inside .ssh/ folder. It will ask for path and passphrase where you can just press enter and proceed.

cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen
Copy the key. You can view your key using. If you hadn't specified a different path then this is the default one.

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Add this key to your github account. Next do

ssh -T git@github.com
You will get a welcome message in your console.

cd into to your project folder. git push -u origin master now works!
